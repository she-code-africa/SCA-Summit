          <h3>THE LARGEST COMMUNITY OF WOMEN IN TECH SUMMIT</h3>
          <p>
            Our first edition of what we intend to make our annual headline
            conference this year aims to change that. Our goal is to gather our
            members from different states in Nigeria and neighbouring African
            countries for a hybrid summit themed "Elevating the African Woman in
            Tech". We plan to host 1,000 women participants for the first
            edition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to create a space safe where these women attendees can
            have different empowering conversations and training on different
            skills/career fields in tech while networking with notable women in
            the tech industry and paterning Companies.
